Hello and welcome! I am Aritra Biswas, a Machine Learning Engineer at AB InBev and an independent researcher with a deep-seated passion for making analytics more intuitive and accessible. Originally from the vibrant city of Calcutta, I now reside in the bustling tech hub of Bangalore.
In my professional life, I am dedicated to developing cutting-edge products that bridge the gap between complex data and user-friendly solutions. My interests span across mathematics, statistics, and computer science, which fuel my drive for innovation in the field of machine learning.
As a proud millennial, when I am not immersed in my work, you can find me indulging in my hobbies of reading, cooking up a storm in the kitchen, and exploring new cuisines like a true foodie on a mission. My love for travel has taken me to various corners of the world ðŸ‡µðŸ‡±, ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·, ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡­, ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¾ ,ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬ â€” where Iâ€™ve probably eaten my weight in local delicacies.
I also enjoy sharing my thoughts and experiences through blogging, because why keep all the fun to myself? Join me on this journey as we explore the fascinating realms of technology, data, and beyond together. Trust me, itâ€™s going to be a deliciously fun ride!
