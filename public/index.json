If you take a deep dive into it\u0026rsquo;s functionality of or formula based approach in case of GLM, it is quite evident including the summary function.\nHere in this post our objective will be to take this ExponentialSmoothing from statsmodels and build a model class which looks like sklearn model and the method signatures are same in nature so there is less learning curve involved when there is a context switch or in this case a user is trying to build different models.\nfrom statsmodels.tsa.holtwinters import ExponentialSmoothing\rfrom sklearn.base import BaseEstimator, RegressorMixin\rfrom sklearn.utils.validation import check_X_y, check_array, check_is_fitted\rfrom sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_percentage_error\rimport numpy as np\rimport pandas as pd\rimport inspect\rclass HWTimeSeriesSkLearnWrapper(BaseEstimator, RegressorMixin):\rdef __init__(\rself,\rtrend=None,\rdamped_trend=False,\rseasonal=None,\rseasonal_periods=None,\ruse_boxcox=False,\roptimized=True,\rremove_bias=False,\rinitialization_method = None,\rmodel=ExponentialSmoothing,\r):\rargs, _, _, values = inspect.getargvalues(inspect.currentframe())\rvalues.pop(\u0026quot;self\u0026quot;)\rfor arg, val in values.items():\rsetattr(self, arg, val)\rdef fit(self, X, y = None):\rif not X.empty:\rself.X = X\rself.model_ = self.model(\rself.X,\rtrend=self.trend,\rseasonal=self.seasonal,\rseasonal_periods=self.seasonal_periods,\rdamped_trend=self.damped_trend,\ruse_boxcox=self.use_boxcox,\r)\rself.result_ = self.model_.fit(\roptimized=self.optimized, remove_bias=self.remove_bias\r)\rself.level = self.result_.level\rself.trend = self.result_.trend\rself.season = self.result_.season\rself.fitted_values = self.result_.fittedvalues\rreturn self\rdef predict(self, X, y = None):\rcheck_is_fitted(self, \u0026quot;result_\u0026quot;)\rself.df = self.result_.forecast(X.index.size).to_frame()\rself.df.columns = [f\u0026quot;predicted_{name}\u0026quot; for name in X.columns]\rself.df.index.name = X.index.name\rreturn self.df\rdef score(self, X, y):\ry_true = X.to_numpy().flatten()\ry_hat = self.predict(X).to_numpy().flatten()\rreturn mean_absolute_percentage_error(y_true= y_true, y_pred=y_hat)\r As you can see in the above block, I have come up with this structure which can take all the args of __init__ and fit of ExponentialSmoothing while initializing the wrapper class HWTimeSeriesSkLearnWrapper.

In the next block, I am downloading the data and creating a train test split. Note, in case of time series we need to remember two things,\n Train test split can not be random There is no such concept of train and test data. Index is kind of your core feature along with meta features which can be derived from target.  The catch here is we need to create train and test in a way it can look like sklearn model but under the hood it should be able to use the same datasets for building times series model using statsmodels or any other library you may use.\ndef get_and_split_airline_data(test_size = 0.2, date_col = \u0026quot;month\u0026quot;, date_format = \u0026quot;%Y-%m\u0026quot;, date_freq = \u0026quot;MS\u0026quot;):\rdf = pd.read_csv(\u0026quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbrownlee/Datasets/master/airline-passengers.csv\u0026quot;)\rdf.columns = df.columns.str.lower()\rif date_col in df.columns:\rdf[date_col] = pd.to_datetime(df[date_col], format = date_format)\rdf = df.sort_values(date_col).set_index(date_col)\rdf.index.freq = date_freq\rtrain_size = int(df.shape[0] * (1 - test_size))\rX_train = df.iloc[:train_size]\rX_test = df.iloc[train_size:]\ry_train = X_train.copy()\ry_test = X_test.copy()\rreturn X_train,X_test,y_train, y_test\r Finally, once we have the data we can use fit, predict and score to calculate the required values.\nX_train,X_test,y_train, y_test = get_and_split_airline_data()\rmodel = HWTimeSeriesSkLearnWrapper(trend = \u0026quot;add\u0026quot;, damped_trend = True, seasonal = \u0026quot;add\u0026quot;, seasonal_periods = 12)\rmodel.fit(X_train, y_train)\rmodel.predict(X_test)\rmodel.score(X_test, y_test)\r ","date":1671494400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1671511439,"objectID":"306b43df964f0105ab47bb177d7c3147","permalink":"https://academic-demo.netlify.app/post/exponential-smoothing-using-scikit-learn-wrapper-statsmodels/","publishdate":"2022-12-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/exponential-smoothing-using-scikit-learn-wrapper-statsmodels/","section":"post","summary":"As we discussed in previous post, in this series we will be working on different type of regression problem and will try to parse them as sklearn model objects.

When you are trying to implement best model it is not possible to use just a single library or even a single language and compute infra. Also, note all the libraries are do not have the same method, signature and input and output. Hence if you are working on a library which is collection of multiple models from different library one good starting point can be to standardize you class, methods, signature and input and output. It helps us to avoid confusion, make things consistent and as result, when you are onboarding a new user, it takes them less time to learn things.\nAt high level, it may sound easy to create common API structure for all the models but it is not. Many models take input in form of np.ndarray, pd.Series, pd.DataFrame, xarray objects and some libraries implement their own data object. To handle this project my current go to approach is to parse the inner working of a model in a sklearn wrapper with common methods, signature and input and output. In this example, we will see how we can do this using cvxpy as optimizer and sklearn wrapper to generate a sklearn model object. Same thing can be done for statsmodels, pytorch, tensorflow or any other custom logic.\nTo start with we can create a conda virtual env (assuming conda is already installed. Otherwise install conda python 3.8 first and then revisit this.). Run the following block to create a virtual env in conda and install the required libraries,\nconda create -n sklearn_wrapper python=3.8 -y\rconda activate sklearn_wrapper\rpip install scikit-learn cvxpy jupyter notebook pandas\r Once this is done, we are good to start. Open a jupyter notebook and execute the following lines in a cell,\nfrom sklearn.base import BaseEstimator, RegressorMixin\rfrom sklearn.utils.validation import check_X_y, check_array, check_is_fitted\rimport cvxpy as cp\rimport numpy as np\rimport pandas as pd\r Here we are importing BaseEstimator and RegressorMixin which our custom model class will inherit from. BaseEstimator will have default score method which can be over written and RegressorMixin will have get_params and set_params methods which can be useful later while execution to change to value of a model parameter. Other than these we are importing check_X_y, check_array and check_is_fitted from sklearn which will be used to check if the X and y we are passing is of sklearn convention or not, the variable we are passing is of array type of not and check_is_fitted is to prevent runningpredict before fit. If we run predict, any model will expect coeff or weight to make any prediction, until we run fit methods, these values will not be generated.\nclass CVXSkLearnWrapper(BaseEstimator, RegressorMixin):\rdef __init__(self, alpha=1.0):\rself.alpha = alpha\rdef _loss_fn(self, X, y, beta):\rreturn cp.norm2(X @ beta - y)**2\rdef _regularizer(self, beta):\rreturn cp.norm1(beta)\rdef _obj_fn(self, X, y, beta, lambd):\rreturn self._loss_fn(X, y, beta) + lambd * self._regularizer(beta)\rdef _mse(self, X, Y, beta):\rreturn (1.0 / X.shape[0]) * self._loss_fn(X, Y, beta).value\rdef fit(self, X, y):\rX, y = check_X_y(X, y)\rn = X.shape[1]\rbeta = cp.Variable(n)\rlambd = cp.Parameter(nonneg=True)\rproblem = cp.Problem(cp.Minimize(self._obj_fn(X, y, beta, lambd)))\rlambd.value = self.alpha\rproblem.solve()\rself.coeff_ = beta.value\rself.intercept_ = 0.0\rreturn self\rdef predict(self, X):\rcheck_is_fitted(self)\rX = check_array(X)\rreturn X @ self.coeff_\r Here is the implementation LASSO using CVXPY as SKLearn model. Here in __init__ method we are taking alpha as user input. Note, all the argument in __init__ method should have a default values. While storing them in self the argument name of __init__ and reference in self should be same. For example if we are using __init__(self, alpha=1.0) then it must be store in self as self.alpha = alpha. This is a parameter which can be changed during execution using get_params and set_params method. To know about this optimization more check this link. Note, here inside fit method we have X, y = check_X_y(X, y) this is not ensure that the X, y variable we have passed to the fit method is correct with respect to data type and share. Also, fit method of sklearn always return self. In case of sklearn this is convention that any variable within in class with have a suffix _. Here also we are saving, coefficients in self.coeff_. Also, in predict we are using check_is_fitted(self) to check that the model has been fitted or not. I am using check_array(X) in fit to ensure that the argument X is of type array.\nIn the following block we are generating some synthetic data to fit the above model. Here beta_star is the true parameter. X and Y is the data on which we will fit the model and will try to estimate unknow beta_star with derived beta_hat.\ndef generate_data(m=100, n=20, sigma=5, density=0.2):\r\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot;Generates data matrix X and observations Y.\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\rnp.random.seed(1)\rbeta_star = np.random.randn(n)\ridxs = np.random.choice(range(n), int((1-density)*n), replace=False)\rfor idx in idxs:\rbeta_star[idx] = 0\rX = np.random.randn(m,n)\rY = X.dot(beta_star) + np.random.normal(0, sigma, size=m)\rreturn X, Y, beta_star\r In the following block we are generating the synthetic dataset, initializing lasso model with class CVXSkLearnWrapper and CVXSkLearnWrapper. After that we are executing fit which will generate the coeffs beta_hat, predict will generate prediction y_hat and score will calculate R-sq between y and y_hat.\nX, y, _ = generate_data()\rlasso = CVXSkLearnWrapper(alpha = 1.1)\rmodel = lasso.fit(X, y)\rmodel.predict(X)\rmodel.score(X, y)\r Notes:\n Here we are using RegressorMixin but depending on the model type it any can ClassifierMixin, RegressorMixin, ClusterMixin or TransformerMixin. All the methods and signature of them should be same if you are implementing more than one model to build a library. If you have _ prefix before any method in the model class, it will not be exposed. It will be considered as internal method and can be accessed with the class. If we inherit from BaseEstimator \u0026amp; RegressorMixin there will be a default score function but it can be overwritten. To change score function in hyper-parameter tuning you can use make_scorer and greater_is_better in it. Dynamic parsing of args is possible in __init__ method using inspect module,  import inspect\rdef __init__(self, arg1, arg2, arg3, ..., argN):\rargs, _, _, values = inspect.getargvalues(inspect.currentframe())\rvalues.pop(\u0026quot;self\u0026quot;)\rfor arg, val in values.items():\rsetattr(self, arg, val)\r  In this example, we are overwriting case score function using mean_absolute_percentage_error. Lets assume that for some reason we want to use MAPE instate as default scoring method it can be useful. Other using make_scorer can be used for any other custom score function or other sklearn score functions.  from sklearn.base import BaseEstimator, RegressorMixin\rfrom sklearn.utils.validation import check_X_y, check_array, check_is_fitted\rimport cvxpy as cp\rimport numpy as np\rimport pandas as pd\rfrom sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_percentage_error\rclass CVXSkLearnWrapper(BaseEstimator, RegressorMixin):\rdef __init__(self, alpha=1.0):\rself.alpha = alpha\rdef _loss_fn(self, X, y, beta):\rreturn cp.norm2(X @ beta - y)**2\rdef _regularizer(self, beta):\rreturn cp.norm1(beta)\rdef _obj_fn(self, X, y, beta, lambd):\rreturn self._loss_fn(X, y, beta) + lambd * self._regularizer(beta)\rdef _mse(self, X, Y, beta):\rreturn (1.0 / X.shape[0]) * self._loss_fn(X, Y, beta).value\rdef fit(self, X, y):\rX, y = check_X_y(X, y)\rn = X.shape[1]\rbeta = cp.Variable(n)\rlambd = cp.Parameter(nonneg=True)\rproblem = cp.Problem(cp.Minimize(self._obj_fn(X, y, beta, lambd)))\rlambd.value = self.alpha\rproblem.solve()\rself.coeff_ = beta.value\rself.intercept_ = 0.0\rreturn self\rdef predict(self, X):\rcheck_is_fitted(self)\rX = check_array(X)\rreturn X @ self.coeff_\rdef score(self, X, y):\ry_hat = self.predict(X)\rreturn mean_absolute_percentage_error(y, y_hat)\r  All the hyper-parameters (not derived from data) has to be initialized in __init__ method. Any model parameters (derived from data) must be initialized in fit. Variable names in init should be always same as arg name and variables in fit should always have a suffix _. fit and predict are mandatory methods in BaseEstimator class.

BREAKING CHANGE: this is a change where multiple modules and high level APIs are getting changed. build: These are not linked with semver. any build level changes has to be tagged as build. for example, if we are changing some configuration in setup.py that should be tagged as build commit. chore: updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change ci: change in any of the github workflow or azure pipeline level changes has to be tagged as ci commit. docs: any changes in wiki documentation or library docstring level changes has to be tagged as docs. style: if there is any changes in code due to formatting or linting those can be tagged as style change. refactor: if some code is being refactored that has to be tagged as refactored commit. perf: for profiling a code base use pref tag. test: for any commit related to tests can be tagged as test.

Lets call it minipackage. We need to manage the version of the library \u0026amp; need to generate the CHANGELOGS.md whenever we release a version of the library. There are multiple ways to solve this problem. Here in the post we are going see how we can use semantic versioning to solve this problem.\nProject directory structure  minipackage: All the source code for the python library will live here.  __init.py__: Library version, other meta data will be here. Also, we need to register any external methods we want to expose as API in the library. main.py: main module is kind of representation of any module and sub-module which will be part of the python library.   pyproject.toml: This file will have all the meta-data related to the tools which we will be using this project. In the example, tool.commitizen example is present but there can be many more settings registered in this file related to the other tools being used in the project. README.md: self explanatory. requirements.txt: All the python dependencies required for the library. .pre-commit-config.yaml: git pre-commit hooks. Here in this example we have just shown the commitizen pre-commit hook example. But there can be many other as well. setup.py: all the library building related information will be here.  If you want to refresh some basics of python library building process checkout this link. Regarding pre-commit checkout this link.\n.\râ”œâ”€â”€ minipackage\râ”‚Â â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py\râ”‚Â â”œâ”€â”€ main.py\râ”œâ”€â”€ pyproject.toml\râ”œâ”€â”€ README.md\râ”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt\râ”œâ”€â”€ .pre-commit-config.yaml\râ””â”€â”€ setup.py\r pyproject.toml: project tools and metadata related to tools used in project version and version_files these are the two import field which has a major impact in this workflow. make sure that version_files field points to the file which is the single source of version. We also need to ensure that we will be using the same file and variable all across the project. While start a project __version__ in __init__.py and version variable in pyproject.toml file should match.\n[tool.commitizen]\rname = \u0026quot;cz_conventional_commits\u0026quot;\rversion = \u0026quot;0.0.1\u0026quot;\rversion_files = [\r\u0026quot;minipackage/__init__.py\u0026quot;,\r\u0026quot;pyproject.toml:version\u0026quot;\r]\rtag_format = \u0026quot;v$version\u0026quot;\rbump_message = \u0026quot;bump: $current_version â†’ $new_version [skip-ci]\u0026quot;\r Note, here in our example here we using the variable __version__ in all place in the project to manage the version and the same file is mentioned in the pyproject file. Now, when we using commitizen to bump version of the library it will change value of this variable depending on the commit message tags. Also, this will generate a changelog.md file in the project root directory and create a release tag.\nsetup.py: library build related information In this section, notice that we using __version__ variable from minipackage module here. We are passing this __version__ variable to in version argument in setup function. This will ensure whenever we are building a library, the library gets tagged with this version.\nNote, that whatever is being defined or imported in minipackage/__init__py file will be present in in minipackage module.\nfrom setuptools import find_packages, setup\rfrom minipackage import __version__\rsetup(\rauthor=\u0026quot;Aritra Biswas\u0026quot;,\rauthor_email=\u0026quot;pandalearnstocode@gmail.com\u0026quot;,\rpython_requires=\u0026quot;\u0026gt;=3.8\u0026quot;,\rinstall_requires=requirements,\rinclude_package_data=True,\rkeywords=\u0026quot;minipackage\u0026quot;,\rname=\u0026quot;minipackage\u0026quot;,\rpackages=find_packages(include=[\u0026quot;minipackage\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;minipackage.*\u0026quot;]),\rversion=__version__,\r)\r source/__init__.py: main place where the version variable is being used This will be the initial state of the init file.

Here we are going to use the following tools to develop the REST API endpoints,\n Fast API SQLModel SQLite Alembic  Prerequisite:  Anaconda DB browser for SQLite curl  Code repository:  Fast API + SQLite + SQLModel + Alembic (Sync version) Fast API + SQLite + SQLModel + Alembic (Async version)  Sample API workflow: Workflow:  Write database models Write database settings Write REST API endpoints Test APIs Setup alembic Change database models Update APIs Run alembic migration Test APIs  Project structure: .\râ”œâ”€â”€ app\râ”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ db.py : All the settings related to DB will be here.\râ”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py\râ”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ main.py : All endpoints will be defined here.\râ”‚ â””â”€â”€ models.py : All the data models will be defined here.\râ””â”€â”€ database.db : This SQLite DB will be created and data will be stored here.\r Step 1: Setup development environment Create a local development conda environment to run the application from local. Here we are going to use python 3.8. After creating the environment install the required dependencies.\nconda create --name fastapi_sqlmodel python=3.8\rconda activate fastapi_sqlmodel\rpip install fastapi[all] sqlmodel alembic aiosqlite\r Step 2: Create database models in models.py Here we are going to define a database model to store information related to task name. Task table is the table which will be updated later with the task description information and we will perform a migration to see how the changes are going to be maintained and reflected in the database.\nfrom sqlmodel import SQLModel, Field\rclass TaskBase(SQLModel):\rtask_name: str\rclass Task(TaskBase, table=True):\rid: int = Field(default=None, primary_key=True)\rclass TaskCreate(TaskBase):\rpass\r Step 3: Create settings related to DB in db.py Here for rapid prototype we are going to use sqlite local db. Which is kind of a standalone file. To view the record in the file we can we use the DB browser for SQLite. After we run the application a a file called database.db will be created in the root directory of the project.\nSync version: Here are going to create two functions which will create all the required tables when the FastAPI application starts and will generate a session using which I/O operations will be performed in a DB.\nfrom sqlmodel import Session, SQLModel, create_engine\rsqlite_file_name = \u0026quot;database.db\u0026quot;\rsqlite_url = f\u0026quot;sqlite:///{sqlite_file_name}\u0026quot;\rconnect_args = {\u0026quot;check_same_thread\u0026quot;: False}\rengine = create_engine(sqlite_url, echo=True, connect_args=connect_args)\rdef create_db_and_tables():\rSQLModel.metadata.create_all(engine)\rdef get_session():\rwith Session(engine) as session:\ryield session\r Async version: Asyn version of the above defined functions which will be used in main.py.\nfrom sqlmodel import SQLModel\rfrom sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio import AsyncSession, create_async_engine\rfrom sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker\rsqlite_file_name = \u0026quot;database.db\u0026quot;\rsqlite_url = f\u0026quot;sqlite+aiosqlite:///{sqlite_file_name}\u0026quot;\rengine = create_async_engine(sqlite_url, echo=True, future=True)\rasync def init_db():\rasync with engine.begin() as conn:\rawait conn.run_sync(SQLModel.metadata.create_all)\rasync def get_session() -\u0026gt; AsyncSession:\rasync_session = sessionmaker(\rengine, class_=AsyncSession, expire_on_commit=False\r)\rasync with async_session() as session:\ryield session\r Step 4: Define API endpoints in main.py Here we are going to define a POST endpoint using which we can write some task related information in the database. As of now, the request model for this endpoint is TaskCreate and in the response this endpoint will return an object of type Task.\nSync version: from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends\rfrom sqlmodel import Session\rfrom app.db import create_db_and_tables, get_session\rfrom app.models import Task, TaskCreate\rapp = FastAPI()\r@app.on_event(\u0026quot;startup\u0026quot;)\rdef on_startup():\rcreate_db_and_tables()\r@app.get(\u0026quot;/ping\u0026quot;)\rdef pong():\rreturn {\u0026quot;ping\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;pong!\u0026quot;}\r@app.post(\u0026quot;/task/\u0026quot;, response_model=Task)\rdef create_task(task: TaskCreate, session: Session = Depends(get_session)):\rdb_task = Task.from_orm(task)\rsession.add(db_task)\rsession.commit()\rsession.refresh(db_task)\rreturn db_task\r Async version: from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends\rfrom sqlmodel import Session\rfrom app.db import create_db_and_tables, get_session\rfrom app.models import Task, TaskCreate\rapp = FastAPI()\r@app.on_event(\u0026quot;startup\u0026quot;)\rdef on_startup():\rcreate_db_and_tables()\r@app.get(\u0026quot;/ping\u0026quot;)\rdef pong():\rreturn {\u0026quot;ping\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;pong!\u0026quot;}\r@app.post(\u0026quot;/task/\u0026quot;, response_model=Task)\rdef create_task(task: TaskCreate, session: Session = Depends(get_session)):\rdb_task = Task.from_orm(task)\rsession.add(db_task)\rsession.commit()\rsession.refresh(db_task)\rreturn db_task\r Step 5: Test API endpoints Here we are going to test the API endpoints are working fine or not. If we get the expected result from the CURL and can validate the records are being updated in the DB we can expect that the APIs are working fine.\nuvicorn app.main:app --reload\rcurl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/task/ -H 'accept: application/json' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{\u0026quot;task_name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;just added task\u0026quot;}'\r Note:\n a database.db file will be create in project root directory. after making the post call validate the db records are being updated using DB browser for SQLite  Step 6: Setup alembic Step 6a: Generate alembic settings In this step we are going generate all the settings for alembic migration. This will generate some files and folders in the project root directory.\nSync version: alembic init alembic\r Async version: alembic init -t async alembic\r Step 6b: Update alembic settings After these files are generated, change the DB url in alembic.ini.\nSync version:  replace sqlalchemy.url = driver://user:pass@localhost/dbname in alembic.ini with sqlite:///database.db.  Async version:  replace sqlalchemy.url = driver://user:pass@localhost/dbname in alembic.ini with sqlite+aiosqlite:///database.db.  Common changes for Sync \u0026amp; Async version:  in alembic/env.py file add from sqlmodel import SQLModel in the import section. in alembic/env.py file add the following line in import section, from app.models import Task. in alembic/env.py change target_metadata = None to target_metadata = SQLModel.metadata. in alembic/script.py.mako add import sqlmodel in the import section.  Step 6c: Generate alembic migration settings After making all the changes, make first migration.\nalembic revision --autogenerate -m \u0026quot;init\u0026quot;\ralembic upgrade head\r Step 7: Update data models in models.py Now, lets say there is some changes we need to add to our data model. In this case we are just going to add task_description. task_description will be a optional string column in the Task table. After we make the required changes in the app/models.py and app/main.py, we need to run the migration to add the newly added columns in the DB.\nfrom sqlmodel import SQLModel, Field\rfrom typing import Optional # This is a new add line\rclass TaskBase(SQLModel):\rtask_name: str\rtask_description: Optional[str] = None # This is a new add line\rclass Task(TaskBase, table=True):\rid: int = Field(default=None, primary_key=True)\rclass TaskCreate(TaskBase):\rpass\r Step 8: Update API endpoints in main.py In this case, endpoints remains unchanged but in a realistic scenario endpoints has to be changed to take the new information into account.\nStep 9: Run DB migration Run the following line to update the database tables.\nalembic revision --autogenerate -m \u0026quot;add description\u0026quot;\ralembic upgrade head\r Step 10: Test updated API endpoints As last step, make a call to the API endpoints which will be using the updated table and check if everything is working fine or not.\nuvicorn app.main:app --reload\rcurl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/task/ -H 'accept: application/json' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{\u0026quot;task_name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;just added task\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;task_description\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;a newly created task\u0026quot;}'\r  after making the post call validate the db records are being updated using DB browser for SQLite  Conclusion: This workflow is quite good when in come to rapid prototyping. One can use this inside a docker container as well but make sure that the volume mounting is in place to keep the standalone database file and the other related alembic migration scripts.\nReference:  FastAPI with Async SQLAlchemy, SQLModel, and Alembic Async SQL (Relational) Databases FastAPI + SQLModel + Alembic SQL (Relational) Databases Building a Phone Directory with Python, MySQL, FastAPI, and Angular Alembic: Auto Generating Migrations Build an async python service with FastAPI \u0026amp; SQLAlchemy How to set up FastAPI, Ormar, and Alembic tiangolo/uvicorn-gunicorn-fastapi-docker  ","date":1634342400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1634348073,"objectID":"e81c776cd8e2fb3a98f0abd907f6811f","permalink":"https://academic-demo.netlify.app/post/local-development-environment-with-fast-api-sqlmodel-sqlite-alembic-sync-async-version/","publishdate":"2021-10-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/local-development-environment-with-fast-api-sqlmodel-sqlite-alembic-sync-async-version/","section":"post","summary":"This is important to have a working local development environment for quick prototyping and developing CRUD application using Fast API.
