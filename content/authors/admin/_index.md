Hello and welcome! I am Aritra Biswas, a Machine Learning Engineer at AB InBev and an independent researcher. Originally from the vibrant city of Calcutta, I now reside in the bustling tech hub of Bangalore. My interests span across mathematics, statistics, and computer science, which fuel my drive for innovation in the field of machine learning.

As a proud millennial, outside of work, you can find me indulging in my hobbies of reading, cooking and exploring new cuisines. My love for travel has taken me to  ðŸ‡µðŸ‡±, ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·, ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡­, ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¾ ,ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬ â€” where Iâ€™ve probably eaten my weight in local delicacies.

I also love sharing my experiences through blogging. Join me as we dive into the exciting world of technology and dataâ€”it's going to be a deliciously fun ride!
